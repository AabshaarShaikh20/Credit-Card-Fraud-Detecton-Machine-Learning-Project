# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

# Project Aim
The main aim of this project is to detect the fraudulent transactions made by credit cards by the use of machine learning techniques, to stop fraudsters from the unauthorized usage of customersâ€™ accounts. 

### Dataset Link :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

## Steps Followed
Step 1: Loading the dataset..

Step 2: Performing EDA

Step 3: Checking Imbalance in the data

Step 4: Checking for missing values

Step 5: Defining features and target( X containing all features except the target variable Class, and y containing all the target variable)

Step 6: Normalize the features using StandardScaler 

Step 7: Handling class imbalance using SMOTE to oversample the minority class (fraudulent transactions).

Step 8: Spliting the data into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio.

Step 9: Trained the model using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest

Step 10: Evaluating the model using classification_report, confusion_matrix and accuracy.
